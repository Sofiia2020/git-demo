Stefania mum mum Stefania
The field blooms, but she is turning grey
Sing me a lullaby mum
I want to hear your native word

She rocked me; gave me rhythm and probably the power of will; did not take, but she gave
Probably knew even more and from Solomon
I will always walk to you by broken roads
She will not awaken, wonâ€™t wake, me in strong storms
She will take two fig signs from grandma, as if they were bullet
